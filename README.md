# Task Management System

This is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. The application allows users to manage tasks by creating, updating, and deleting them.

## Assignment Tasks

### Set up the project

1. Create a new MERN stack project structure.
2. Set up a MongoDB database and establish a connection to it.
3. Initialize an Express.js server and configure it to handle API requests and serve static files.
4. Create a basic React.js frontend structure with necessary components and routing.

### Implement the backend

1. Define the necessary data models and schema for tasks using Mongoose.
2. Implement RESTful APIs in Express.js to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
3. Implement appropriate validation and error handling for API requests.
4. Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT) to secure API endpoints.
5. Implement appropriate error handling middleware for handling server errors.

### Develop the frontend

1. Create a form for users to add new tasks, including title, description, and due date.
2. Display a list of tasks on the main page, showing key details such as title, due date, and completion status.
3. Implement functionality to update task details and mark tasks as completed.
4. Implement functionality to delete tasks from the list.
5. Add appropriate form validation and error handling for user input.

### Deployment

Document the deployment process and provide instructions for deploying the application locally or on a hosting platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

   ```shell
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the MongoDB database and update the connection details in the backend configuration file.

4. Start the development server for both the backend and frontend.

   ```shell
   # Start the backend server
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Start the frontend server
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the production-ready version of the frontend.

   ```shell
   # Build the frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the backend server to your hosting platform, making sure to set the necessary environment variables and configuring any required server settings.

3. Serve the built frontend files using your hosting platform or a static file server.

4. Update the frontend API endpoint URLs to point to your deployed backend server.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing task data.
- Express.js: Web framework for building the backend server and RESTful APIs.
- React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- JWT: JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the frontend.
