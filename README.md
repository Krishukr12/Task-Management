- React.js: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface and handle client-side rendering.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side scripting.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js used for database operations.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the client-side to the server-side.
